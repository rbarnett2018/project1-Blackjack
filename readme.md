## Black Jack - Aka 21!

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://imgur.com/a/5pKb269)

A game of Blackjack where you compete against the dealer which is equipt with the fundamental blackjack knowledge and rules. Simply read the instructions, click play and choose your probable fate by chosing to either take a "Hit" to add onto your cards value, or "Stay" to settle with the cards dealt. The nearest player to 21 and nothing more wins, a draw ends with the dealer winning, per casino rules. Enjoy!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [Play] - The "Play" button starts the game and deals the dealer and yourself two cards each. 
- [Hit] -  The "Hit" button deals one card to your 'hand' and adds the cards value to your total card value.
- [Stay] - The "Stay" button tells the dealer that you'd like to stay with the cards dealt, then the dealer starts dealing themselves cards until they exceed 17.
    - [Logic] - Nested features of the game consist of thousands of lines of logic involving the dealer's thought process and where/how to deal the cards at a random non-duplicated order.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
