    <h1>Blackjack (21) </h1>
    <h4> Instructions: </h4>
     <h5>You are competing against the Dealer in a game of Black-Jack also known as 21. You will be dealt two cards which each hold numeric values. The dealer will be dealt two as well, yet one is not visible. Your goal is to either beat the dealer to "21" or to try to get a higher number than the dealer without exceeding "21", which would result in a "bust", then the dealer wins. The dealer will continue to take "hits" until their value is greater than or equal to 17. You have the option to either "hit", which means take an additional card or, you can "stand", which means keep the cards as-is. Highest number value or first to 21 wins, a tie results in the dealer winning.</h5>
